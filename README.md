# Welcome to AngularJS on CloudBees

This is a "ClickStart" that gets you going with the AngularJS "seed" project starting point. You can launch it here: 

<a href="https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart/master/clickstart.json"><img src="https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png"/></a>

This will setup a continuous deployment pipeline - a Jenkins build running the test suite (on each commit) with Chrome and Firefox.
Should it pass the tests, this seed app is deployed served up from a tiny node.js server (you 
can then clone and mess with it, or change the backend to what you need). 

AngularJS home page is [Here](http://angularjs.org/)

The Angular-seed project is [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)

When you run this clickstart - you will have the latest version of the seed project running.
